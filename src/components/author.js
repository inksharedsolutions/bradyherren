                                A book reader turned a book writer. His stories are a glimpse of his memoirs and his encounters with the pristine nature where he grows up. Looking back on his writing career, he had to say that it is a gift that came from his earliest attempts at capturing an inspiring event that he would feel was in need of being recorded.
