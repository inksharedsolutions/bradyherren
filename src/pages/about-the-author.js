                                This is needed to establish a unique and strong foundation about you as the author- Born is central Texas, now lives in East Texas. Started playing Fantasy Roll Play Games in 1984, MERP (Middle Earth Roll Play), some GURP’s and a lot of Role Master. Was a game master for a long time, then the wife at the time wanted to be the Game Master and one of our gaming buddies wanted to be the GM. I was out of work for a little while and bored, a friend said write about the game. That started many years ago. Now I finally have the first book professionally edited and published.
